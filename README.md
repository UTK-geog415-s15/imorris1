I'm Ian Morris. I was born in Atlanta, but I grew up here in Knoxville and am now a junior here at the University of Tennessee. I'm studying both Geography and Spanish, and am planning on majoring in both of them. I'm still not completely sure what I'd like to do with my career after graduating, but I'm interested in meteorology and climatology, as well as the Spanish language. Well, thanks for reading!
